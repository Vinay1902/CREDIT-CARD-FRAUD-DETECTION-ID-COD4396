     Certainly! Below is the Python code implementing the Credit Card Fraud Detection project, covering data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and documentation:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('credit_card_transactions.csv')

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# 2.1 Data Cleaning
# Assuming data cleaning steps have already been performed

# 2.2 Feature Engineering
# Normalize transaction amount
scaler = StandardScaler()
data['normalized_amount'] = scaler.fit_transform(data['Amount'].values.reshape(-1,1))
data.drop(['Time', 'Amount'], axis=1, inplace=True)

# 2.3 Handling Class Imbalance
# Explore class distribution
print("Class Distribution:")
print(data['Class'].value_counts())

# Perform oversampling using SMOTE
X = data.drop('Class', axis=1)
y = data['Class']
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)

# Step 3: Splitting the Dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_resampled, y_resampled, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 4: Model Training
# Train logistic regression model
lr_model = LogisticRegression()
lr_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Train random forest classifier
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 5: Model Evaluation
# Evaluate logistic regression model
lr_y_pred = lr_model.predict(X_test)
print("\nLogistic Regression Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, lr_y_pred))
print("\nLogistic Regression Confusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, lr_y_pred))

# Evaluate random forest classifier
rf_y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)
print("\nRandom Forest Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, rf_y_pred))
print("\nRandom Forest Confusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, rf_y_pred))

# Step 6: Visualization (Optional)
# Plot confusion matrix for logistic regression model
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
cm_lr = confusion_matrix(y_test, lr_y_pred)
plt.title('Logistic Regression Confusion Matrix')
sns.heatmap(cm_lr, annot=True, cmap='Blues', fmt='g')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.show()

# Plot confusion matrix for random forest classifier
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
cm_rf = confusion_matrix(y_test, rf_y_pred)
plt.title('Random Forest Confusion Matrix')
sns.heatmap(cm_rf, annot=True, cmap='Blues', fmt='g')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.show()
```

This code performs the following steps:

1. **Load the dataset**: Reads the credit card transactions dataset from a CSV file.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleans the data (assumed to be already done).
   - Normalizes the transaction amount.
   - Handles class imbalance by oversampling using SMOTE.
3. **Splitting the Dataset**: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Training**:
   - Trains a logistic regression model.
   - Trains a random forest classifier.
5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluates both models using classification report and confusion matrix.
6. **Visualization (Optional)**: Generates confusion matrices for both models using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Ensure to replace `'credit_card_transactions.csv'` with the path to your dataset file. Additionally, make sure to install required libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `imbalanced-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` if you haven't already.

This code provides a comprehensive implementation of the Credit Card Fraud Detection project, addressing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optional visualization for better understanding.
